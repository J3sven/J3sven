In my spare time I do volunteer work on the **HDOS** OldSchool RuneScape client project. This project is aimed at re-creating the 2008-2011 era RuneScape HD look for OldSchool RuneScape through a reverse engineered client dating back to 2009. On the project my primary focus is porting over RuneLite plugins and making them compatible with our client. Though I have also delivered core client features and contributed art assets and tooling that boosts our artist productivity.
